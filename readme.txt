WPC Free Gift Coupons for WooCommerce offers a new way to give away free gifts to customers during special sale occasions.

== Description ==

WPC Free Gift Coupons for WooCommerce offers a new way to give away free gifts to customers during special sale occasions. It’s not just about giving a promotion code. A gift coupon can assign one or more products as gifts while still functioning as a normal coupon by discounting an amount or a percentage.

Users can create the coupon as a standalone free gift code or integrate the “gift” part to an existing WooCommerce coupon on your site. The gifts can be simple products, variable products, or selected variations. Single or multiple coupons can be applied at the same time on the cart page based on the specific settings.
